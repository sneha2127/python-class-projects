# Operator:
# Expression: 5+6, where 5,6 are operands and + is operator

# Arithmatics Operators, Comparison operators, Logical operators and Assignment Operators

# Arithmatic operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, //
num1 = 2
num2 = 5
# print(num1+num2) 
# print(num1-num2)
# print(num1*num2)
# print(num1/num2)  # Floating Division
# print(num1//num2)  # integer Division  or floor division
# print(num1%num2)  # return Remainder
# print(num1**num2)  # 2^5

# ceil and floor value
# num = 0.9 , ceil = 1, floor = 0
# num = 2.5 , ceil = 3, floor = 2


# Comparison operators: It compares two values and returns boolean valuee i.e. True and False
# >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=

# print(num1 > num2)
# print(num1 < num2)
# print(num1 >= num2)
# print(num1 <= num2)
# print(num1 == num2)
# print(num1 != num2)


# Logical Operators: and , or, not. It is used to perform on two or more than two boolean values and return single boolean values

# and: Both Conditions true, then returns True otherwise False
# age = 23
# print(age>20 and age < 25)

# or: Both Conditions False, then returns False otherwise True
# age = 5
# print(age > 20 or age < 30)

# not: Convert True to False and Vice Versa
# age = 17
# print(not age<18)


# Assignment operator: =, +=, -=, *=, /=
# number = 10
# print(number) #10

# number += 10 # number = number + 10
# print(number)  #20
# number -= 10 # number = number + 10
# print(number)  #10
# number *= 10 # number = number + 10
# print(number) #100
# number /= 10 # number = number + 10
# print(number) #10.0



# -----------------------------------



# String Concatination: We did it by using + operator
# f_name = "Pritam"
# l_name = "Dutta"
# full_name = f_name+ " " +l_name
# print(full_name)




# input(prompt): It is used to take user input and returns the user input in the form of string

user_name = input("Enter the name: ")
print("Hi, Good Morning, " + user_name + "!")
